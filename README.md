Glass \[Live\] Card Examples
=========

This is a project that shows you examples of creating live cards (not immersions) on Google Glass via the GDK.

The initial card that is launched is a simple Chronometer that shows duration since launch.

Each of the cards have a menu that allows you to switch between the 3 cards, and it stops the other cards to launch the desired card.
